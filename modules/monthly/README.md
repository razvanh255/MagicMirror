It's purpose is to enable a mini-calendar with as many months as the user wants, assuming screen space is available.

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the config/config.js file:

```
{
  module: 'monthly',
	position: 'top_left', 				// can be any of the postions
	config: { 					// Optional - will default to 3 months, with one previous and one next, vertical orientation. 
		startMonth: -1, 			// Define when you start from current month (negative is before current, zero is current, positive is in future) 
		monthCount: 3, 				//  How many months to display - If Month Count is 1, Calendar will show previous and next month dates in empty spots.  
		monthsVertical: true, 			// Whether to arrange the months vertically (true) or horizontally (false).
		repeatWeekdaysVertical: false,		// Whether to repeat the week days in each month in vertical mode. Ignored in horizontal mode.
		weekNumbers: false, 			// Whether to display the week numbers in front of each week.
		highlightWeekend: false, 		// Highlight Saturday and Sunday
	}
},
```
